## Velocity Statistics

### Average Velocity
```
Average Velocity = (Sprint 1 + Sprint 2 + Sprint 3) / 3
Average Velocity = (39 + 43 + 58) / 3
Average Velocity = 140 / 3
Average Velocity = 46.67 SP/sprint
```

**Average Velocity: 46.67 SP per sprint**

### Velocity Trend
- **Sprint 1:** 39 SP (baseline)
- **Sprint 2:** 43 SP (+4 SP, +10.3% increase)
- **Sprint 3:** 58 SP (+15 SP, +34.9% increase from Sprint 2)

**Trend:** Increasing velocity over time

### Velocity Analysis

**Sprint 1 (39 SP):**
- Foundation sprint
- Establishing patterns and infrastructure
- Learning curve for team coordination
- Baseline velocity established

**Sprint 2 (43 SP):**
- 10.3% increase from Sprint 1
- Team more familiar with codebase
- Established patterns and processes
- Improved efficiency

**Sprint 3 (58 SP):**
- 34.9% increase from Sprint 2
- Team fully familiar with project
- Higher complexity stories (5 SP) included
- Peak efficiency achieved
- Final sprint with comprehensive features

## Cumulative Velocity

| Sprint | Sprint SP | Cumulative SP | Cumulative Average |
|--------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Sprint 1 | 39 SP | 39 SP | 39.00 SP |
| Sprint 2 | 43 SP | 82 SP | 41.00 SP |
| Sprint 3 | 58 SP | 140 SP | 46.67 SP |

## Velocity Forecasting

### Based on Average Velocity (46.67 SP/sprint)
- If project continued, expected velocity: **46-47 SP per sprint**
- For 140 SP project: Required **3 sprints** (actual: 3 sprints) ✅

### Velocity Prediction Accuracy
- **Initial Estimate:** 39-43 SP per sprint (based on Sprint 1-2)
- **Actual Average:** 46.67 SP per sprint
- **Accuracy:** Project completed within planned sprints

## Velocity Chart Data

For creating a velocity chart in Excel or similar tool:

```
Sprint,Planned SP,Completed SP
Sprint 1,39,39
Sprint 2,43,43
Sprint 3,58,58
```

**Chart Type:** Column chart showing Planned vs Completed SP per sprint

## Key Insights

1. **Increasing Velocity:** Team velocity increased over time, indicating:
   - Improved team coordination
   - Better familiarity with codebase
   - Established development patterns
   - Efficient agile practices

2. **Sprint 3 Peak:** Highest velocity in Sprint 3 reflects:
   - Team at peak efficiency
   - Higher complexity stories (5 SP) included
   - Final push for completion
   - Comprehensive feature set

3. **Consistent Delivery:** All sprints completed on time with planned SP
   - Demonstrates good sprint planning
   - Accurate story point estimation
   - Effective team coordination

4. **Team Balance:** Individual velocities balanced across team members
   - Fair workload distribution
   - Effective task assignment
   - Balanced contributions

---

## Recommendations for Future Sprints

1. **Use Average Velocity:** 46-47 SP per sprint for planning
2. **Account for Complexity:** Higher complexity stories (5 SP) require more buffer
3. **Maintain Patterns:** Continue established development patterns
4. **Balance Workload:** Maintain balanced distribution across team members

## Notes

- Velocity is measured in Story Points (SP)
- All sprints completed as planned (100% completion rate)
- Velocity trend shows improvement over time
- Team successfully delivered all planned features within 3 sprints
